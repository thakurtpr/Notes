<<<<<<<---------Elasticsearch Endpoints------->>>>>>>>>


A wealth of information! Elasticsearch provides numerous endpoints to interact with your data. Here are some essential endpoints to get you started:

<=======Indexing Data======>
PUT /{index}: Create an index with optional settings and mappings.
PUT /{index}/_doc/{id}: Index a document with a specified ID.
POST /{index}/_doc/: Index a document without specifying an ID (Elasticsearch generates one).


<=======Retrieving Data======>
GET /{index}/_doc/{id}: Retrieve a document by ID.
GET /{index}/_search: Search for documents using a query.
GET /{index}/_search?q={query}: Search for documents using a query string.


<=======Updating Data======>
POST /{index}/_update/{id}: Update a document by ID.
POST /{index}/_update/_doc/{id}: Update a document by ID (alternative syntax).


<=======Deleting Data======>
DELETE /{index}/_doc/{id}: Delete a document by ID.
DELETE /{index}: Delete an entire index.


<=======Other Endpoints======>
GET /_health: Check the health of your Elasticsearch cluster.
GET /_cluster/state: Retrieve cluster state information.
GET /_nodes: Retrieve information about nodes in your cluster.
GET /_settings: Retrieve settings for your cluster or index.


When running Elasticsearch in Docker, you'll need to access these endpoints using the container's IP address or hostname,
followed by the port number (default is 9200). For example:
http://localhost:9200/myindex/_doc/1


Replace localhost with the IP address or hostname of your Docker container.
Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and Elasticsearch provides many more endpoints for advanced use cases. 
You can find the complete documentation on the official Elasticsearch website.
