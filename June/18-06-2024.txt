1) Ingress:


Before we are having ratio  based load balancing 
we are having whitelisting and blacklisting feature in load balancing 



for every service we have to define different ip's 
as a result gcp was charing for each of these ip's  (statis load balancer ip's)
this problem is solved by ingress

Load Balancing : Round Robin
ProblemS: 
1)Enterprise & TLS Load Balancing 
2)Static Load Balancer  ::::::::::::::::::[][][][][[][][][[][][][: 

How ingress Solves this Problems : 
 Create a Resource Called Ingress Resource : 
	Ingress Controller Will search for the ingress yaml resource for their k8s services  it will provide the path based routing 
	
	
	Host Based , Path Based , TLS  Based Routing 
	
	
	installing ingress controller---------------------->>>>>> making an ingress resource --------------->>>>>>>>>
	
	
	***** vim ingress.yaml
	(*) kubectl apply ingress.yaml
	(*) minikube enable ingress  --->> this will create an ingress resource of type nginx 
	(*) kubectl get pods -A | grep ingress 
	(*) kubectl logs ingress-nginx-controller-cc8496874-trh6c -n ingress-nginx 
	(*) 
	
	
	
	Install ingress Controller --> Nginx Ingress controller will watch for the ingress Resource --> it then updated the nginx.conf -->>
	
	
	
	Notes:=   ****Along with the ingress controller nginx application is also deployed****
	
	
	(*) SSL Passthrough : = 
	(*) SSL offloading : = https request is decrypted by the load balancer and then http request is sent to the application in plain text 
	(*) SSL Briding : = it decrypts the data and then send by re-encrypt the data and then send the request to the application
