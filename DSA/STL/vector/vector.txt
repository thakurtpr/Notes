A vector in C++ is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed. 
It is a contiguous container, meaning all elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.

Insert : Inserts one or more elements at a specified position.
Erase : Removes one or more elements from a specified position.

Size : Returns the number of elements in the vector.
Capacity : Returns the maximum number of elements the vector can hold.
Resize : Changes the size of the vector.
Empty : Checks if the vector is empty.
Front : Returns a reference to the first element.
Back : Returns a reference to the last element.
At : Returns a reference to the element at a specified position.
Operator[] : Accesses the element at a specified position.
